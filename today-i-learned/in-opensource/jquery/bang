Today I learned that using !! is a safer way to check if something exists then I'd been doing it.

if(foo)
  bar();

can throw errors, in many confusing ways, and I use long winded solutions to fix it only after it blew up my thread.

but if you first coerce the value to a boolean with ! then coerce it back to its boolean equivalent with another !
the result will always be true of false.

I heard this before in a kyle simpson course on front end masters but his courses dive so deep and I was such a noob (still am but) that I was like ohhh I get it but I never really got it enough to use it in my projects.
Saw jquery do it, ask chat gpt about it and BOOM it all makes sense.
bang bang ftw!
