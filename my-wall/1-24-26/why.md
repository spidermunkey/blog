I really think it'll be cool if after a couple months of consistent effor I'll be able to churn out apps with fine grain control very quickly using whatever tool I need.

For example I feel like the timers app that I'm working on could've been finished over a weekend off or a week in the hours before and after works if I really understood how to utilize tool-kits like react + tailwind + redis + redux +- postgres.

So let's just get on with it!
