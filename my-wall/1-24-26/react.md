Let's Learn React!

Building projects with vanilla js is a pleasant challenge and I plan to continue finishing my projects however, with working 2 jobs for a total of 7 working days a week I can only allocate so much mental energy towards the complexity of it. I think it's best, until I can find more free time, to commit atleast 2hours a day. This still leaves about 4hours a day that I'm idle, I can use that to learn about ui frameworks and maybe learn some techniques that can speed up my vanilla projects.

Not only that but, most of the time spent on my app is idle time just wrestling with design and functionality of the app. When I step back ideas flow in easier, so I can step back and learn something new while doing it.

I've been fighting the urge to follow the crowd and learn react or any framework for that matter so I can really sharpen my skills, but I've reached the point where I know a decent amout. Ultimately this means that I know more or less everything I need to know to build the projects however the complexity of them requires alot of time and effort and I don't think anyone sane would build what I'm attempting to build from scratch.

I guess it's time for the next chapter
