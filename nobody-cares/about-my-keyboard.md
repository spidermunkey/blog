Yes mechanical keyboards make a difference.
Yes form factor makes a difference.
Yes switches make a difference.

My first keyboard was from office depot.
wasn't mechanical but looked like it. some red lazer switches idk..
it was great I didn't get faster in fact i got slower but I was more comfortable and it pulled me in to working often with the shiny red backlights.

My second was from walmart. I wanted something smaller. didnt like it though because it didnt have cursors. never used it.

My current is a keychron k6 with yellow switches...
It looks cooler.
I'm typing faster with yellow switches.
Takes up less space.

I remember thinking, do keyboards really make a difference... whats the hype all about.
Well it makes such a difference that I felt compelled to write this post.
